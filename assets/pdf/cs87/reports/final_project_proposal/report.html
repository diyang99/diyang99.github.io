We are inspired by this first image of aeroplane, and considering to combine this with some features shown in the second image. The beautiful colour displayed out from the smoke vortex line filaments generated by the plane impressed us a lot, and so we would like to render the similar phenomenon with our stylization. In addition, to highlight the colour and remark the “lines” in this case, we would like to create as well some detail-preserved shining and glistening effect within the volumetric medium.

(##) Proposed features and points

* A list of features relevant to your image that you'd like to implement along with a tentative point breakdown which sums up to 16 points.

We decides to implement

*  Photon mapping
*  Parallelized ray tracing
*  Volumetric path tracing

(##) Stretch goals (optional)

*  (Possible Feature) Implement our own smoke simulator
*  (Already Implemented) Normal mapping
*  (Possible Feature) Better sampler if needed

(##) Division of labor/collaboration plan

We aim for a half by half division of workload.
