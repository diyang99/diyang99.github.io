Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am currently a Master student at Dartmouth College, majoring in Computer Science with concentration in Digital Arts, advised by Professor Bo Zhu in Visual Computing Lab.

Before coming to Dartmouth, I received my Bachelor of Science with Joint Honors in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University. It is my fortune to work with Professor Paul Kry and Professor Jean-Christophe Nave on numerical method for physically-based simulation during my undergraduate studies.

My research interests lie in computer graphics, especially on physically-based animation, around which I would like to explore more topics on computational physics, visual scene understanding and machine learning.<a nonsmooth="1" href="../assets/pdf/cv20230913.pdf" class="">[CV]</a><br />
